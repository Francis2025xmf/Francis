# Canada’s aging population

*By: Francis Diawuoh*

Executive Summary
Canada’s aging population is growing rapidly, with seniors (65+) projected to make up 25% of the population by 2036. The fastest-growing demographic is those aged 85 and older, with over 62,000 Canadians expected to be 100+ by 2063. However, increased lifespan brings rising healthcare challenges, including a 40% surge in cancer cases by 2030 and a 66% rise in dementia over the next 15 years.

Canada’s healthcare system, originally designed for acute care, struggles to meet seniors’ complex, chronic care needs, with nearly 80% of seniors managing at least one chronic condition. This project examines the state of seniors’ healthcare, identifies key challenges, and explores innovations and policy solutions to ensure accessible, high-quality care for Canada’s aging population

## Key Performance Indicators
1.	Hospitalization Rate for Seniors: This measures how often seniors are admitted to the hospital, indicating how well chronic health conditions are being managed and whether there are gaps in preventive care or access to alternative treatments like home care.
2.	Hospital Readmission Rate for Seniors: This tracks the percentage of seniors who are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. A high readmission rate suggests potential issues with discharge planning, follow-up care, or continuity of treatment after hospitalization.
3.	Incidents (Falls, Pressure Ulcers, Medication Errors, and Infections): This KPI looks at the frequency of adverse events, such as falls, pressure ulcers, medication errors, or hospital-acquired infections, occurring in healthcare settings. These incidents can indicate concerns with the quality of care, staff training, or safety protocols in place.
4.	Number of Medication Reviews Conducted: This reflects how often seniors receive a thorough review of their medications to ensure they are taking the right prescriptions in the correct dosages. Regular reviews can prevent medication errors, interactions, and side effects, which are common in the elderly due to polypharmacy.
5.	Instances of Unintended Weight Loss and Malnutrition: This measures how many seniors experience significant weight loss or malnutrition, which can be signs of underlying health issues, inadequate nutrition, or a lack of support services. Addressing malnutrition is crucial for improving overall health outcomes and reducing hospitalizations.
6.	An “age-friendly” system must aim to create a continuum that reduces dependency and enhances care as much as possible.
