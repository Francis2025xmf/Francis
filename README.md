Executive Summary
Canada’s aging population is growing rapidly, with seniors (65+) projected to make up 25% of the population by 2036. The fastest-growing demographic is those aged 85 and older, with over 62,000 Canadians expected to be 100+ by 2063. However, increased lifespan brings rising healthcare challenges, including a 40% surge in cancer cases by 2030 and a 66% rise in dementia over the next 15 years.

Canada’s healthcare system, originally designed for acute care, struggles to meet seniors’ complex, chronic care needs, with nearly 80% of seniors managing at least one chronic condition. This project examines the state of seniors’ healthcare, identifies key challenges, and explores innovations and policy solutions to ensure accessible, high-quality care for Canada’s aging population
