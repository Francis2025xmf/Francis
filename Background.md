# Evaluating the State of Seniors Healthcare in Canada: Challenges, Innovations, and Policy Recommendations
Executive Summary
Canada’s population is aging. Statistics Canada reports that over 15% of population at the last census was over 65, it was 7.6% in 1960. For the first time there are more people aged 65 and older than there are children aged 0-14 years. Based on population projections the share of Canadians 65 and older will continue to rise and that by 2024 they will account for 20.1% of the population. By 2036 seniors are expected to make up 25% of the population. People aged 85 years and over make up the fastest growing age group in Canada.
 This portion of the population grew by 127% between 1993 and 2013.Statistics Canada projects, based on a medium growth scenario, there will be over 62,000 Canadians aged 100 and older by 2063.5 However, the quantity of years will be meaningless without a corresponding improvement in quality to complement it.
The aging Canadian population is expected to create an increase of about 40% in cancer cases by 2030 This will result in 277,000 new cases of cancer in 2030. The number of Canadians living with dementia is expected to rise 66% over the next 15 years. The risk of dementia doubles every five years after the age of 65 
Canada’s health care system was not built to meet the challenges of our aging population. Canada’s Medicare system was established to deal largely with acute, episodic care for a relatively young population. Today, the system struggles to properly care for patients many of whom are elderly  managing complex and ongoing health issues. Approximately 75-80% of Canadian seniors report having one or more chronic condition.
## Problem
1.	Shortcomings in Seniors' Care: How Canada Compares to its Peers and the Paths to Improvement
2.	Among 11 countries surveyed by the Commonwealth Fund, Canada’s seniors’ care ranks eighth, ahead only of France, the UK and Sweden. At the provincial level, some provinces compare more favourably to international jurisdictions while others, particularly Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec, sit at the bottom of the ranking. PEI, Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba, rank above the Commonwealth Fund international average overall, but no provinces achieve the international average on equity, based on race, for example, or access to care, based on affordability and timeliness.
3.	Comparing provincial senior’s care to other jurisdictions reveals the magnitude of domestic shortcomings in care for seniors. Paths to improvement include better access to care and greater equity, where Canada ranks second last.

## Significance of the Study.
Canada's rapidly aging population poses significant healthcare challenges that require urgent attention. By 2030, cancer cases are projected to rise by 40%, leading to 277,000 new diagnoses. Additionally, dementia cases will increase by 66% over the next 15 years, with the risk doubling every five years after age 65.
The current healthcare system was designed for acute, episodic care and struggles to meet the needs of seniors facing chronic and complex conditions. Currently, 75-80% of Canadian seniors report having at least one chronic illness, and by 2041, seniors will have the highest rate of mental illness in the country.
The growing demand for caregiving is also a major concern, with nearly 3 in 10 Canadians serving as family caregivers and the number of seniors needing care expected to double in the next 30 years.
This study is significant because it highlights the urgent need for healthcare reform to address these challenges. By examining current gaps and proposing solutions, it aims to contribute to the development of a more age-friendly, sustainable healthcare system for Canada's senior population.
## Research Objectives 
1.	The Purpose is to examine the accessibility, affordability, and quality of healthcare services for seniors across different provinces and territories and also Identify disparities in healthcare outcomes among seniors based on demographics, socioeconomic status, and geographic location.
2.	Investigate the barriers to accessing healthcare services, including wait times, provider shortages, and long-term care facility availability.Analyze the financial burden of healthcare on seniors, including out-of-pocket expenses, medication costs, and private insurance gaps.
3.	Examine the impact of chronic diseases, mental health issues, and age-related conditions on healthcare demand.
4.	The research objective is to assess the effectiveness of technology-driven healthcare solutions, such as telemedicine, AI-assisted diagnostics, and remote monitoring. To achieve this we have to explore the community-based and home care models that promote aging in place and reduce reliance on institutional care.
5.	The aim is to review existing healthcare policies and programs targeted at seniors, including government-funded initiatives and private-sector contributions.
